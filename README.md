This work is based on the work by Russ Hughes

I modified his MicroPython driver for the st7789 to include both a circle and fill_circle method.

The driver has been tested on the Raspberry Pi Pico with a Waveshare 2 inch 240x320 module.

I also modified his vga2_16x16.py font file to be a decimal file, rather than hex.  The file will be used in BIPES at some point.
